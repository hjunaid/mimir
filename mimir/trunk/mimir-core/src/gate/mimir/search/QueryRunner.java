/**
 * A QueryRunner object can be used to execute a query in a separate thread. The
 * query execution will be performed in stages, each being limited to a given 
 * number of maximum hits or a set timeout. During the query execution 
 * statistics are made available about the number of hits currently obtained for
 * each document. The hits already collected can be accessed in a random 
 * fashion.
 * 
 * N.B. Documents are referred to in two different manners: 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>by documentId: the ID associated with the document at indexing time, 
 *   which never changes</li>
 *   <li>by index: the index in the list of documents found to contain hits.</li>
 * </ul>
 * You can tell which addressing scheme is used based on the of the parameter.
 * 
 * Implementations of this interface must be thread-safe!
