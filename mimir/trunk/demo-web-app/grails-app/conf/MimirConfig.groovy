 // Mimir configuration.  Values in this file get merged into the main
// GrailsApplication.config under gate.mimir, with values specified directly in
// Config.groovy overriding those specified here (and values in external
// configuration files overriding that, as usual).  So you can override (say)
// the queryTokeniserGapp setting from this file by specifying
//
// gate.mimir.queryTokeniserGapp = "...."
//
// in Config.groovy or a grails.config.locations external file.

// default GATE initialisation params - we do not specify pluginsHome or
// siteConfigFile as these take sensible defaults from gateHome
