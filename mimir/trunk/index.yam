Mímir: Multiparadigm Indexing and Retrieval

Concept search, full-text search and annotation structure search in one
scaleable index: "Mímir is a multi-paradigm information management index and
repository which can be used to index and search over text, annotations,
semantic schemas (ontologies), and semantic meta-data (instance data). It
allows queries that arbitrarily mix full-text, structural, linguistic and
semantic queries and that can scale to gigabytes of text. A typical semantic
annotation project deals with large quantities of data of different kinds.
Mímir provides a framework for implementing indexing and search functionality
across all these data types."

GATE Mímir is open source software, released under the
%(http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html, GNU Lesser General Public
Licence 3.0), with the source code hosted at SourceForge.
We do not supply ready-built binaries as there are too many possible deployment configurations. Instead we encourage you to download the sources and build your own binaries. For recent release versions we provide archives of the entire source tree on our %(https://sourceforge.net/projects/gate/files/mimir/, SourceForge downloads) page. If you require an older release, or want to try out the current trunk version (unstable), then you will need to use a %(http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html, subversion client) to check out the appropriate source directory, e.g. ^svn checkout \http://svn.code.sf.net/p/gate/code/mimir/trunk^ for the trunk. You can browse our %(http://svn.code.sf.net/p/gate/code/mimir/, subversion repository) to find out which URL to use for your checkout command.

Alternatively you can buy a ready-to-run virtual server with GATE Mímir installed from %(https://gatecloud.net/, GATECloud.net).
