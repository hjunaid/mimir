This appendix details the main changes in each \Mimir\ release.

\section{Version 3.3.0 (October 2011)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Added support for marking documents as ``deleted'' (see
section~\ref{sec:admin:takedown}).

\item Major changes to the format of the Index Template Groovy DSL (see
section~\ref{sec:indexing:templates}).  The old format provided by \Mimir\
3.2.0 is still supported for existing semantic annotation helper types, but
new helper types in future may not be supported in the old style DSL.

\item Added the {\em SPARQL} semantic annotation helper (see
section~\ref{sec:plugins:sparql}).

\item Updated versions of a number of libraries (H2 database to 1.3.160, OWLIM
to 3.5, MG4J to 4.0, fastutil to 6.4, dsiutils to 2.0).

\item The \verb|ordi| semantic annotation helper plugin is now deprecated.  Use
the \verb|sesame| plugin instead, which supports the same on-disk format for
its annotation storage but uses a different library to access it.

\item Fixed various bugs and memory leaks (see subversion logs for full
details).

\end{itemize}
