MÃ­mir is undergoing major re-engineering. The current trunk is not guaranteed to
work (or even compile!). If you need a stable version, please use one of the 
release tags, or the 3.4 branch, all of which can be found at:

- https://gate.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gate/mimir/tags
- https://gate.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gate/mimir/branches
